# The to-do list

 * Copy highlighting colors for dark backgrounds from luainspect/scite.lua.
 * OMNI completion for in scope variables (including display of library function signatures).
 * Fix improvised hack by using new `luainspect.signatures.value_signatures` table.
 * Document g:lua_inspect_path option.
 * Check whether "core/SciTE: jump to definition now supports functions in different files." is interesting.
