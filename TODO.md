# The to-do list

 * Right now the highlighting styles used by `luainspect.vim` are the same as those used by the SciTE plug-in and they don't work well on dark backgrounds. As soon as I get around to picking some alternate colors I'll include those in the plug-in.

 * Bindings for other features of LuaInspect like renaming variables on command and showing tooltips for identifiers. This might be a lot of work but could prove to be really useful in making Lua easy to use in Vim.

 * Document the g:lua_inspect_path option.
